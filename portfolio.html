<div class="about-me">
    <p>After a career of promoting other people's creations I am branching out as a web developer to create and promote some of my own. I am currently in the Thinkful Engineering Immersion Bootcamp
       to help fulfill this goal.  I've always been too curious for my own good and now I'm using my skills for four main purposes:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Compose code and apps to make new things work.</li>
              <li>Optimize current apps to make good things work better.</li>
              <li>Develop new 'toys' to help accomplish the first two goals</li>
              <li>Experience the world both inside and outside of the computer screen.</li>
            </ol>

     <h2>Things to know about me</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>I'm not just a code composer but I'm a music composer as well.</li>
         <li>I consider myself an expert 'pop culturalist' especially in all things in the 90s.</li>
         <li>The first book I ever read in my life and sparked my curious streak is a comic book.</li>
         <li>I like to use both code and music to build things relating to everything above like below:</li>

        <h3>Project 1: A 90's R&B Quiz App</h3>
        <img class='90s-app-photo' src="images/90sappphoto1.png" alt="photo of first project">
        <p>Project Description: I've always wanted to show the world how influential this era of music has been even to this day.  So with
        a partner I created a Buzzfeed-like quiz app for other to test their own knowledge of 90's R&B music.</p>
        <p>Project Tools: We used Javascript and HTML to build the app with images and GIFs to give a Buzzfeed like feel.</p>
